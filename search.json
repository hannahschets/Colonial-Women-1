    "text": "Indentured Servitude\n\nThe first indentured servants arrived to Virginia in 1624\nIt was typical for indentured servants to be bound for three to five years after their arrival in the colonies\nMany times, someone would agree to an indenture contract because they could not afford the cost of transportation to the Americas\n\nSome people were “spirited” or kidnapped to be taken to the New World and sold into servitude (Snyder)\n\n\n\n\nShift to Enslaved Laborers\n\nAs indentured servitude became more financially burdensome in the colonies, farmers turned to enslaved labor.\nThis switch might be due to the switch from subsistance to staple crop farming.\nWith a higher demand for staple crops, there was a higher demand for skilled labor.\nAs operations grew, white laborer’s roles changed from doing labor work to working as overseerers and plantation managers.\nAs time went on, enslaved laborers born in the colonies became less expensive to traffic and train. (Galenson)\n\n\n\nEnslavement\n\nEnslaved laborers roles differed by plantation.\nSkilled and unskilled laborers were required to run a plantation.\nEnslaved workers were trafficked and purchased, and had no opportunities to become free except for manumision.\n\n\n\nLabor\n\nAt the beginning of the colonial period, labor was typically unskilled with a shift to skilled labor happening with the introduction of staple crops.\nTasks of skilled laborers might include building storage sheds, packing products, and transporting products.\nAs operations grew, white skilled laborers shifted their roles to working as overseerers and managers.\nThe two most requested skills for laborers in the 1640s were construction and carpentry. (Galenson)\n\n\n\nIsolation\n\nEnslaved and Indentured Black women were heavily isolated in the colonial period.\n\nThe disperal of homesteads led to the disperal of people\n\nBlack women had little connection to their culture or community (Gunderson)"

(Gundersen)\nColonial women tended to have more successful births than their English relatives due to higher health. (Kirkman)\n\n\n\n\nVirginia Population by Year\n\n\n\n\nPublic and Private Life\n\nIn the early colonial period, wealthy women were allowed to exist within the public sphere, but this changed in the later colonial period.\n\nWomen were expected to stay within private life and not enter into public spheres.\nThe public sphere was seen as a man’s world.\nAfter 1700, a woman’s value was found in their femininity, not in their political status.\nSome women made their own methods of participating in the public sphere.\n\nSome women made charity organizations or participated in church activities and groups.
